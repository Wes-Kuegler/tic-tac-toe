# Tic-Tac-Toe
This project was originally created as a coding exercise for an employer. The prompt was simple: create a basic tic-tac-toe game to demonstrate Python acumen.
The graphics are bare-bones, and the game must be re-run to play again. Despite its shortcomings, I think this work is a good sample of my coding style and Python proficiency. 

Uses Python 3.9 and pygame 2.5.2.
